        <p>Congratulations on your Wedding!</p>
        <p>Hope you like the card, its not my best work given the time crunch but at least I managed to pull it off!</p>
        <p>First off, Congratulations! You’re the first of our generation here who’s getting married! The road ahead is
          definitely a blurry one and who knows how many bumps you’re going to hit along the way… But I know you’ll
          power through them the way we all do!</p>
        <p>I’m really happy you finally have a partner to support and cherish each other in good times and tough</p>
        <p>I wish you a long and happy marriage!</p>
        <p style="color:white;">~</p>
        <p style="color:white;">~</p>
        <p style="color:turquoise">You can click/tap on the next tab up there /\</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-profile2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-profile-tab2">
        <p>So I was scratching my head on what I can get you as a wedding gift… The day I learned you had finalized the
          date for your marriage I was really short on options and time (shipping especially if needed)</p>
        <p>My dad already gave the red packet so I couldn't just sneak that QR code to you non-chalantly.<Br>So I started thinking...</p>
        <p>First thought was a substation stamp card… Yeah would go well…</p>
        <p>Saw a fountain pen, and thought you definitely have more pens than you need.</p>
        <p>Next was pepper spray, but you already have an army of puppies and a husband</p>
        <p>Then I remember you being half-interested with my torchlight and thought “Hey! A high powered keychain light!
          She can use it when she’s looking for her glasses at 80!”</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>Yeah I ain’t coming out of this one alive…</p>
        <p>X_X</p>
        <p>Aaaanyways, I quickly brought up good ole’ Lazada and quickly ordered the first one that came to my mind.</p>
        <p>A tiny titanium keychain light that can light up 50 meters. Powerful enough to replace your phone and small
          enough for you to completely forget about it on your person</p>
        <p>It’s now set to demo mode which shuts off after 30 seconds. you can set change it so that it lights up permanently by pressing
          both buttons at once to switch it from the default “demo” mode to the “daily” mode.</p>
        <p>Hopefully you like it? If not you can just chuck it in the bin and I’d be none the wiser</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-contact2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-contact-tab2">
        <p>Phew…</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, writing a congratulatory message is a lot more harder than I thought it would. I couldn’t stuff
          the whole message in a card so I decided to stuff it here instead ahaha…</p>
        <p>Seriously, writing and rewriting this in my head, paper and keyboard several times over may have been the
          agonizing thing I have ever done. Do I be overly congratulatory? Should I quote Shakespeare? Write about
          completely unrelated things confusing myself in the process?</p>
        <p>I decided to be myself, turn on the mic, and started talking as if I’m talking to you heart to heart.</p>
        <p>Best idea ever, words were pouring non-stop</p>
        <p style="color:white;">~</p>
        <p>Anyways, this wedding card is most likely the last one of its kind I’ll ever do for anyone.</p>
        <p>I swear, creating animated cards and writing heartfelt messages is seriously not my cup of tea…</p>
        <p>Hope you like the torchlight, and congratulations again!</p>
        <p style="color:white;">~</p>
        <p style="color:white;">~</p>
        <p>Your Cousin</p>
