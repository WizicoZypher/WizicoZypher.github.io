                        <p>I can't simply send it through post or ask your mom to carry something and risk the Australian Customs confiscating it. </p>
                        <p>Then I realized... I can just make a QR code congratulatary card and send it to you!</p>
                        <p>So I decided to spend a whole weekend working on this card since I had nothing else I thought I could give you...</p>

                        <p>Now that you are finally graduating and with your mother as well, this should be the happiest days of your life!</p>
                        <p>There will be more tests and trials ahead but I know you can beat them!</p>
                        <p>Enjoy this period of time just being with your mother and I hope the both of you share a wonderful time together after being seperated for such a long period of time</p>
                        <p>And do not think you need to give me back anything. Your happiness is already plentiful enough and I just want you to be happy, safe, and full of love</p>

                        <p>Sadly I am not able to attend your graduation in person as I have too many responsibilities at work to take care of...</p>
                        <p>I have not been the best to you and never always managed to solve your problems... and I also made your mom worry a few times when I'm doing the documentations and visa work for her</p>
                        
                        <p>I am glad that at least, I managed to help you with your studies a little bit and helped your mom with her visas and airplane tickets...</p>
                        <p>Anyways, this little congratulations card has too much words already, so I will end the card here.</p>

                        <p>Smile! and I hope one day we can finally meet and hangout</p>
